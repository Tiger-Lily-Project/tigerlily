Accolade Elm,Ulmus japonica x wilsoniana ,accolade-elm.jpg,Deciduous,"Accolade is a vase shaped, medium to large, deciduous elm that typically grows to 50-60 feet tall and to 25-40 feet wide. In addition to its excellent disease and pest resistance, it is also noted for its vigorous growth, glossy dark green foliage and good yellow fall color. Non-showy, small green flowers appear in spring before the foliage emerges. Flowers give way to single-seeded, wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened oval-rounded papery wing). Seeds mature in April-May as the leaves reach full size. Glossy, ovate-elliptic, dark green leaves have toothed margins and asymetrical bases. Leaves typically turn a quality shade of yellow in fall."

English Elm,Ulmus procera ,english-elm.jpg,Deciduous,"The field elm (Ulmus minor) cultivar 'Atinia', commonly known as the English elm, formerly common elm and horse may, and more lately the Atinian elm was, before the spread of Dutch elm disease, the most common field elm in central southern England, though not native there, and one of the largest and fastest-growing deciduous trees in Europe. R. H. Richens noted that elm populations exist in north-west Spain and northern Portugal, and on the Mediterranean coast of France that ""closely resemble the English elm"" and appear to be ""trees of long standing"" in those regions rather than recent introductions. Augustine Henry had earlier noted that the supposed English elms planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez from the late 16th century onwards, specimens said to have been introduced from England by Philip II and ""differing in no respects from the English elm in England"", behaved as native trees in Spain. He suggested that the tree ""may be a true native of Spain, indigenous in the alluvial plains of the great rivers, now almost completely deforested"". The English elm was once valued for many purposes, notably as water pipes from hollowed trunks, owing to its resistance to rot in saturated conditions. It is also very resilient to crushing damage, and these two properties led to its widespread use in the construction of jetties, timber piers, lock gates, etc. It was used to a degree in furniture manufacture, but not to the same extent as oak, because of its greater tendency to shrink, swell, and split, which also rendered it unsuitable as the major timber component in shipbuilding and building construction. The wood has a density around 560 kg/m3."

The town of Brookline, Massachusetts has one of the largest, if not the largest, grove of European beech trees in the United States.

Magnolia (Unknown),Magnolia spp.,magnolia.jpg,Unknown,"Magnolia is an ancient genus. Appearing before bees did, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough. Fossilized specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago. Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).The natural range of Magnolia species is a disjunct distribution, with a main center in east and southeast Asia and a secondary center in eastern North America, Central America, the West Indies, and some species in South America."
