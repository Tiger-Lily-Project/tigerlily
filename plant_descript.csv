"""Crimson King"" Norway Maple",Acer platanoides ,,Deciduous,"‘Crimson King’ Norway maple grows to a height of 35 to 45 feet spreading about 25 to 30 feet and is quite popular for its purple-green foliage throughout the summer. Leaves turn brown, dark maroon or bronze in the fall before dropping. The oval to rounded crown fills with maroon-yellow flowers in the spring."
"""Winter King"" Hawthorn",Crataegus viridis,,Deciduous,"‘Winter King’ Hawthorn is a North American native tree which slowly reaches 20 to 30 feet in height and spread. It is very dense and thorny which makes it a popular choice for use as a hedge or as a screen. Unlike other Hawthorns, the thorns are small and inconspicuous. The dark green, deciduous leaves turn beautiful shades of bronze, red, and gold in the fall before dropping. The handsome, silver-grey bark peels off in sections to reveal the inner orange bark, making ‘Winter King’ Hawthorn a striking specimen planting in the winter landscape. The white blooms are followed by large, orange/red fruits which persist on the naked tree throughout the winter."
Accolade Elm,Ulmus japonica x wilsoniana ,,Deciduous,"Accolade is a vase shaped, medium to large, deciduous elm that typically grows to 50-60′ tall and to 25-40′ wide. In addition to its excellent disease and pest resistance, it is also noted for its vigorous growth, glossy dark green foliage and good yellow fall color. Non-showy, small green flowers appear in spring before the foliage emerges. Flowers give way to single-seeded, wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened oval-rounded papery wing). Seeds mature in April-May as the leaves reach full size. Glossy, ovate-elliptic, dark green leaves have toothed margins and asymetrical bases. Leaves typically turn a quality shade of yellow in fall."
American Basswood,Tilia americana,,Deciduous,"American basswood is a medium to large tree, typically 50-80 feet tall at maturity with a rounded crown. Leaves are large (up to 6 inches), ovate, and dark green with acuminate tips, serrate margins, and uneven cordate bases. Its native range includes Minnesota and extends across the eastern half of North America. It produces fragrant pale yellow flowers in late spring and early summer, which give way to a pair of nutlets subtending a leafy bract. Fall color is an undistinguished pale green to pale yellow. Basswood twigs grow in a zig-zag pattern and can be green, red, or brown in color. The buds, like the twigs, can be green or red. The bark on an American basswood tree tends to be gray or brown with shallow, flat-topped ridges."
American Beech,Fagus grandifolia,,Deciduous,"American beech is a large, deciduous tree that may reach heights of up to 120 feet in the wild. This maximum height is far less likely in an urban setting, where 50 to 80 feet is typical. It was recognized by European colonists as being similar to the well-known European beech, giving it its name. American beech produces edible beechnuts that are consumed heavily by a variety of wildlife species. A distinguishing characteristic of the species is the retention of smooth bark in old age. Ovate to elliptical leaves will turn golden bronze in the fall. Yellowish-green flowers appear in the spring, but are not particularly showy. The dense foliage and low branching structure of American beech makes it a visually appealing shade tree, the main barrier to more frequent urban use being its size. "
American Elm,Ulmus americana,,Deciduous,"American elm is a medium to large deciduous tree, typically growing to 60-80’ (less frequently to 130’) tall with a vase-shaped, broad-rounded crown. It is native to eastern and central North America. nsignificant small green flowers appear in spring before the foliage emerges. Flowers give way to single-seeded wafer-like samaras (each tiny seed is surrounded by a flattened oval-rounded papery wing). Seeds mature in April-May as the leaves reach full size. Rough-textured, ovate-elliptic, dark green leaves (to 6” long) have toothed margins and asymetrical bases. Leaves typically turn an undistinguished yellow in fall."
American Holly,Ilex opaca,,Evergreen,"American holly is an upright, pyramidal, evergreen tree that slowly matures to 15-30' in cultivation, but may reach 50' tall in the wild. It is native to the eastern and central U.S., most frequently found in moist woods, forest bottomlands and swamp peripheries plus some coastal dunes. This species is the only native U.S. holly with spiny green leaves and bright red berries. This is the Christmas holly whose berry-laden boughs are typically collected at Christmas time each year for ornamentation (""decking the halls"" as it were). Thick, leathery, deep green leaves have spiny marginal teeth. Greenish-white flowers bloom May-June. Bright red or orange fruits ripen in fall on pollinated female trees, and persist on the tree through winter. Birds love the fruit."
American Hophornbeam,Ostrya virginiana,,Deciduous,"American hophornbeam is a deciduous, Missouri native tree which usually occurs in dry soils on rocky slopes, upland woods and bluffs throughout the State. A small to medium-sized, understory tree with a generally rounded crown. Typically grows 25-40' tall with a slightly smaller spread. Features birch-like, oval to lance-shaped, sharply-serrated, dark yellowish-green leaves (to 5"" long). Leaves turn an undistinguished yellow in autumn and often drop early. Flowers are monoecious (reddish-brown male flowers and greenish female flowers appear in separate catkins on the same tree). Flowers are not particularly showy, although the male catkins are more prominent and are present throughout winter. Female catkins are followed by drooping clusters of sac-like, seed-bearing pods which, as the common name suggests, somewhat resemble the fruit of hops. Also commonly called ironwood because of its extremely hard and dense wood."
