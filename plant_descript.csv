It has a conic crown with level branches and drooping branchlets.[2]mAmong Hindus, as the etymology of deodar suggests, it is worshiped as a divine tree. Deva, the first half of the Sanskrit term, means divine, deity, or deus. Dāru, the second part, is cognate with (related to) the words durum, druid, tree, and true.[3][4]"
Douglas Fir,Pseudotsuga menziesii,,Evergreen,"Pseudotsuga menziesii is an evergreen conifer species in the pine family, Pinaceae. It is native to western North America and is known as Douglas fir,[3] Douglas-fir,[4] Oregon pine,[5] and Columbian pine.[6] There are tree varieties: coast Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. menziesii), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca) and Mexican Douglas fir (P. menziesii var. lindleyana).[7] The common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus Abies. For this reason the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus Pseudotsuga as a whole).[9]"
Dove Tree,Davidia involucrata,,Deciduous,"Davidia involucrata, the dove-tree,[1] handkerchief tree, pocket handkerchief tree, or ghost tree, is a medium-sized deciduous tree in the family Nyssaceae.[2] It was previously included with tupelos in the dogwood family, Cornaceae.[3] It is native to South Central and Southwest China from Hubei to southern Gansu, south to Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan, but is widely cultivated elsewhere."
Eastern Arborvitae,Thuja occidentalis,,Evergreen,"Thuja occidentalis, also known as northern white-cedar, eastern white cedar, or eastern arborvitae, is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to eastern Canada and much of the north, central and upper Northeastern United States,[2][3] but widely cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, and the binomial name remains current."
Eastern Redbud,Cercis canadensis,,Deciduous,"Cercis canadensis, the eastern redbud, is a large deciduous shrub or small tree, native to eastern North America from southern Ontario, south to northern Florida but which can thrive as far west as California. It is the state tree of Oklahoma. Native Americans consumed redbud flowers raw or boiled, and ate roasted seeds."
Eastern Redcedar,Juniperus virginiana,,Evergreen,"Juniperus virginiana, known as red cedar, eastern redcedar,[2][3] Virginian juniper,[4] eastern juniper, red juniper, pencil cedar, and aromatic cedar, is a species of juniper native to eastern North America from southeastern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and east of the Great Plains.[3] Further west it is replaced by the related Juniperus scopulorum (Rocky Mountain juniper) and to the southwest by Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper).[5][6][7] Among many Native American cultures, the smoke of the burning cedar is used to drive away evil spirits prior to conducting a ceremony, such as a healing ceremony.[20] During the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s, the Prairie States Forest Project encouraged farmers to plant shelterbelts (wind breaks) made of Juniperus virginiana throughout the Great Plains. They thrive under adverse conditions – both drought tolerant and cold tolerant, they grow well in rocky, sandy, and clay substrates. "
Eastern Wahoo,Euonymus atropurpureus,,Deciduous,"Euonymus atropurpureus is a species of shrub in the bittersweet family. It has the commons names American wahoo, eastern wahoo, burningbush,[1] and hearts bursting with love.[2] It is native to eastern North America. The fruit is poisonous to humans, but is eaten by several species of birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. It is used medicinally in both the United States and southeastern Canada. The powdered bark was used by American Indians and pioneers as a purgative.[6]"
Eastern White Pine,Pinus strobus,,Evergreen,"Pinus strobus, commonly denominated the eastern white pine, northern white pine, white pine, Weymouth pine (British), and soft pine[1] is a large pine native to eastern North America. It occurs from Newfoundland, Canada west through the Great Lakes region to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota, United States, and south along the Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont to northernmost Georgia and perhaps very rarely in some of the higher elevations in northeastern Alabama.[2] The Native American Haudenosaunee denominated it the ""Tree of Peace"". It is known as the ""Weymouth pine"" in the United Kingdom,[3] after Captain George Weymouth of the British Royal Navy, who brought its seeds to England from Maine in 1605.[4]"
Empress Tree,Paulownia tomentosa,,Deciduous,"Paulownia tomentosa (common names princess tree,[1] empress tree, or foxglove-tree,[2] is a deciduous tree in the family Paulowniaceae, native to central and western China. It is an extremely fast-growing tree, and is a persistent exotic invasive in North America.[3] In Japan, the tree is planted at the birth of a girl.[11] The fast-growing tree matures when she does. When she is eligible for marriage the tree is cut down and carved into wooden articles for her dowry. Carving the wood of Paulownia is an art form in Japan. In legend, it is said that the phoenix will land only on this tree, and only when a good ruler is in power. Several Asian string instruments are made from P. tomentosa, including the Japanese koto and Korean gayageum zithers."
English Elm,Ulmus procera ,,Deciduous,"The field elm (Ulmus minor) cultivar 'Atinia' ,[1] commonly known as the English elm, formerly common elm and horse may,[2] and more lately the Atinian elm[3] was, before the spread of Dutch elm disease, the most common field elm in central southern England, though not native there, and one of the largest and fastest-growing deciduous trees in Europe. R. H. Richens noted that elm populations exist in north-west Spain and northern Portugal, and on the Mediterranean coast of France that ""closely resemble the English elm"" and appear to be ""trees of long standing"" in those regions rather than recent introductions.[4][5] Augustine Henry had earlier noted that the supposed English elms planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez from the late 16th century onwards, specimens said to have been introduced from England by Philip II[6] and ""differing in no respects from the English elm in England"", behaved as native trees in Spain. He suggested that the tree ""may be a true native of Spain, indigenous in the alluvial plains of the great rivers, now almost completely deforested"".[7] The English elm was once valued for many purposes, notably as water pipes from hollowed trunks, owing to its resistance to rot in saturated conditions. It is also very resilient to crushing damage, and these two properties led to its widespread use in the construction of jetties, timber piers, lock gates, etc. It was used to a degree in furniture manufacture, but not to the same extent as oak, because of its greater tendency to shrink, swell, and split, which also rendered it unsuitable as the major timber component in shipbuilding and building construction. The wood has a density around 560 kg/m3.[30]"
English Oak,Quercus robur,,Deciduous,"Quercus robur, commonly known as common oak, pedunculate oak, European oak or English oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech and oak family, Fagaceae. It is native to most of Europe west of the Caucasus. The tree is widely cultivated in temperate regions and has escaped into the wild in scattered parts of China and North America.[3][4] Quercus robur is planted for forestry, and produces a long-lasting and durable heartwood, much in demand for interior and furniture work."
English Yew,Taxus baccata,,Evergreen,"Taxus baccata is a conifer native to western, central and southern Europe, northwest Africa, northern Iran and southwest Asia.[3] It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known, it may now be known as common yew,[4] English yew,[5] or European yew. Primarily grown as an ornamental, most parts of the plant are poisonous, and consumption of the foliage can result in death.[6][7][8][9]"
European Beech,Fagus sylvatica,,Deciduous,"Fagus sylvatica, the European beech or common beech, is a deciduous tree belonging to the beech family Fagaceae. The natural range extends from southern Sweden to northern Sicily,[4] west to France, southern England, northern Portugal, central Spain, and east to northwest Turkey, where it intergrades with the oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), which replaces it further east. European beech is a very popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens in temperate regions of the world. In North America, they are preferred for this purpose over the native F. grandifolia, which despite its tolerance of warmer climates, is slower growing, taking an average of 10 years longer to attain maturity. The town of Brookline, Massachusetts has one of the largest, if not the largest, grove of European beech trees in the United States. The 2.5 acre public park, called 'The Longwood Mall', was planted sometime before 1850 qualifying it as the oldest stand of European beeches in the United States.[17]"
European Carpinus,Carpinus betulus ,,Deciduous,"Carpinus betulus, commonly known as the European or common hornbeam, is a hornbeam native to Western Asia and central, eastern, and southern Europe, including southern England.[1] It requires a warm climate for good growth, and occurs only at elevations up to 600 metres (1,969 ft). It grows in mixed stands with oak, and in some areas beech, and is also a common tree in scree forests. Hornbeam was also known as 'Yoke Elm'.[2]"
