Sycamore,pton,,"Any tree tour should start on the front lawn of Maclean House, where you will find a weathered pair of sycamores ordered by the trustees in 1765. According to legend, they were planted to commerorate the repeal  of the Stamp Act in 1766. These trees,  the oldest on campus,  are barely past adolescence - for  the sycamore,  or ""buttonwood"" (so named because of its button-like seed balls), may live up to 600 years. Native to lowland areas in the East, the sycamore is the most massive of our native trees, and Native Americans favored its trunk for dugout canoes. Perhaps the trustees, preoccupied with the details of running a college, were just to busy to give much thought to landscaping. In any event,  the Stamp Act sycamoores may have been the only trees planted on campus until the dawn of the 19th century."
American Elm,pton,,"The once-doomed American elm, with its arching branches and urn-shaped structure, still survives in large numbers on the University campus. Many of the elms are a local cultivated variety called ""Princeton"" by the late horticulturist William Flemer. These majestic trees stand in allees along Washington Road, Elm Drive, and McCosh Walk and are scattered throughout the campus courtyards. They are still battling the Dutch elm disease fungus, which, left uncontrolled, will block the water flow in the xylem vessels of the trunk and branches. Only one-third of the elms inventoried in 1964 are still standing on campus. The oldest specimen of American elm, one that is well over 200 years old, spreads its branches over the front entrance to the campus behind Stanhope Hall."
London Planetree,pton,,"In the courtyard north of Blair Hall stands the largest London plane tree in the area. In the 18th century, horticulturists crossed the American sycamore (one seed ball per stalk) with the Oriental plane tree (three balls per stalk) to produce the London plane tree (two balls per stalk). As the name implies, the tree is often planted in cities. Like the sycamore, it can be identified by its mottled bark and large, fuzzy leaves."
American Basswood,pton,,"The softest of American forest woods, this smooth-grained tree with abundant foliage provides dense shade to the inner archway between Blair and Joline halls. Its close European relative, the linden, has long been sought for its unique wood and sinewy inner bark, which was used by borne on leaf-like bracts dangling alongside large, dark green leaves. Perfume oils extracted from the flowers and cooking oil extracted from the nuts have made this a very desirable trere throughout history. The age of this particular seven-story giant is unknown, but it was already a stately  shade tree when the courtyard enclosed it at the beginning of the 19th century. Still, this specimen is a youngster compared to some lindens in Central Europe, which are more than 900 years old."
Japanese Pagodatree,pton,,"This large, flowering ornamental tree, planted around the middle of the 20th century, stands near Foulke Hall on the former stire of the Princeton rail station (which served students and townsfolk traveling to Princeton Junction). The tree is native to China, Japan, and Korea and is characterized by compound dark green leaves and tan bark. Many students enjoy its filtered shade but miss the yellowish pea-like summer blossoms that for centuries were used to make a yellow dye. The trees were often planted around Buddhist temples - hence the name pagoda tree. On campus the fleshy, and sometimes slippery, seedpods fall to the walks below, covering the flagstone throughout the winter months."
Kentucky Coffeetree,pton,,"One passes this inconspicuous southern native on the west side of 1901 Hall on the way to the Dinky Station. The beans from its large brown seedpods were roasted and used as a coffee substitute by early Kentucky settlers. Naturally caffeine-free, the beverage never gained popularity. Another reason for lack of commercial success may be the toxic nature of the inner pod pulp. As a member of a larger family of leguminous trees - trees that have beanpods - the Kentucky coffee tree has large compound leaves and grows in colonies in its native woodland habitat."
Cedar of Lebanon,pton,,"This is the cedar of the Bible, and vast stands of such cedars once grew in the Near East before lumbering reduced their numbers. They may live 2,500 years and are unusual in their tortuous, twisting limbs, the lowerst ones forced to the ground below. This cedar stands in a prominent location in Cuyler Courtyard and is a mere 60-plus years old."
English Yew,pton,,"At Prospect House, one can see exotic tree species, some dating to the construction of the house in 1849 or even earlier. These species include a giant sequoia, a Spanish fir, a tigertail spruce, and a Himalayan pine, some of which have identifying plaques. Along the west side of the house stands an English yew,  an evergreen long regarded as a ""tree of life"", and sometimes planted in cemeteries in Europe. Yews have reportedly lived as long as 1,500 years. Like the holly, they are either male or female, and only the latter produce berries. The bark, leaves, and berries of the yew are poisonous, and ancient writers warned against sleeping under yew trees."
Tulip Poplar,pton,,"The tulip poplar is best known for its showy greenish yellow flowers with orange centers. The flowers are borne high on the tree, and hence often go unnoticed until they fall to the ground. The giant 130-foot specimen on the front lawn of Prospect House - one of the tallest trees on the Princeton campus - is more than 160 years old and predates the house.  The circumference is jsut over 16 feet."
Northern Red Oak,pton,,"The northern red oak on the west side of 1879 Hall is the largest of its kind on campus and is close to two centuries old. The northern red oak grows straight and tall and can live up to 500 years.  The New Jersey state tree, it is a relative of the black and scarlet oaks, distinguished by the jagged tips of its large-lobed leaves."
American Beech,pton,,"American beech trees were planted along McCosh Walk in 1964 when Dutch elm disease was destroying the existing American elms. Nineteenth-century beech  trees still stand as the climax trees in the woodlands at the southern end of campus. They are best known for their massive gray trunks and edible beechnuts, which are gathered by the campus squirrel population. Some of the first pages of European  literature were  inscribed by lovestruck boys  inside the outline of a heart on the smooth gray bark. And German brewmasters insist that the bestaging processes for beer include beech chips. A very fine specimen beech stands in the Class of '70 Plaza at Marx Hall."
Ginkgo,pton,,"This species, brought to the United States from Eastern China in the  1780s is sometimes called the maidenhair tree, but it is most commonly known as the ginkgo. One of the oldest trees known to man, it has been growing on Earth for more than 150 million years, and was native to North America at one time. Two of these ancient trees stand along McCosh Walk adjacent to the Prospect House fence. Another budded variety ofthe  gikgo biloba species grows growson the lawn in front of Little Hall, just  south of Edwards Hall. This variety is called ""Princeton Upright""."
American Holly,pton,,"Holly sprigs have been used to decorate American households from colonial times. Their naturally thorny and waxy  green  leaves act as a deterrent to those who wish to observe the trees too closely. The glossy, nonedible, red berries highlight these evergreens during the  late fall and winter months. Hollies are especially  noticeable after heavy rain or when covered with snow. Holly species have been used  by landscape architects as hedges and to flank doorways and patios because they encourage one  to stay ""on the beaten path."" This native New Jersey evergreen has been known to live more than 300 years, and the specimens on campus continue  to age gracefully. The best representatives of the species stand sentry between Whig and Clio halls."
Sugar Maple,pton,,"On the South Lawn of East Pyne Hall stands a grand sugar  maple. Typically found in the mountainous regions of the Northeast, this tall forest species is tapped for its sugary sap, and its tight-grained wood is used for furniture. The ""Green Mountain"" variety was most recently planted around the Princeton Stadium, and in 1990 it was planted along Goheen Walk in front of Schultz Laboratory. It provides roads and walkways with dense summer shade and lustrous golden-orange autumn foliage. Sugar maples are best differentiated from the Emerald Queen Norway maples lining the walk to the west by their sharply pointed vegetative buds."
Japanese Zelkova,pton,,"This species  was once considered a suitable replacement for the doomed American elm. That it is a member of the elm family is obvious when viewing the large specimen on the northeast corner of Nassau Hall. Its vase-shaped form and slightly ascending branches make this species an excellent choice for street trees and walk areas. Many Asian plants were introduced into North America in the late 18th century and planted on university campuses to test their hardiness in this climate. These plants may have existed here prior to the advance of the glaciers that reduced native plant species. China's central mountain ranges stopped the advancing glaciers, saving many native plants; the most recent estimates are around 80,000 species in China, compared to North America's 30."
White Ash,pton,,"A few giant whish ash tree still remain on Cannon Green and east of FitzRandolph Gate. These are among the tallest deciduous trees on campus and may well date from the 1825 replanting of the front lawn of Nassau Hall. At some point following 1800, the three parallel walks  leading to the entrance of Nassau Hall were planted with Lombardy poplars, a stiff and spindly import. The poplars did not last long, however, and in the spring of 1825 the lawn was replanted with native species: elms, ashes, maples, and tulip polars - in the random fashion of the Romantic School of landscape architecture. The huge white ashes lining Cannon Green were probably planted when Joseph Henry laid out the quadrangle in 1836. Notable for their six-foot diameter trunks and diamond-shaped bark, they are still among the most stately trees on campus."
