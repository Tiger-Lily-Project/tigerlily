    This table stores information about the individual instance of a plant on campus.

    status: string holding the plant's status (alive, dead, stump, removed, etc.)

    Note: I also have a lot of environmental info about each tree (lbs of pollutants removed, gallons of runoff prevented, etc.),
    but it's a lot so we can upload it into the table later if we decide we want to use it.

Table name: species_info
    This table stores information about one of the species on campus. Though there might be multiple instances
    of the species on campus (for example, lots of elm trees), each species has one row in this table.

    blurb: string holding additional information about the species.

    I have the common name, latin name, and dec_or_evg for every species. I am still working on blurbs and images.
